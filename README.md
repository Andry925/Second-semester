# FileManger
This is filemanager which is created in order to help you to organize particular files into extension folders with different creation time. .
The Tkinter library was used to build the interface

The program uses os module for working with file paths and directories, while shutil module allows to copy files to requiered directories
and time module helps to determine files which were created for a certain period of time. All these modules are built-in, so that 
you don't need to use pip install.
# Instrunction for usage
First, go to the Ready_app folder and run main.py file. When you do so, the small interface appears.

The second thing you need to do is to think up name for mainfolder, you can choose any name, **_but you must make sure that folder with 
that name  does not exist on your computer_**. Mainfolder is the main directory inside it will be placed other 
extensions-named folders, such pdf, docx, txt, etc. 

The third, choose the period of time for files you need. You can choose any, **_but I don't recommend type too big number_**.

The fourth, choose the extensions you want **_type extensions with dot like .pdf, .docx and separate them with one space_**.

The fifth, choose the directory for mainfolder, **_type full path to directory_**.

The sixth, choose the path from where your files will be copied at, **_also enter full path".

The last one, decide whether you want to delete these files or not, **_press Yes, if so_**.

Here is the correct example of filling application form.

Then push Run code button and wait until program finishes its work. After that, you can go to the path you choose for mainfolder to
check what you have.
